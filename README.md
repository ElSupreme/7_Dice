# 7_Dice

A simple math dice game (and solver) utlizing seven dice.

The goal of this project is to learn how to write computer programs. I have a small handheld toy that contains seven dice. There are 5 multicolored dice, and one black die around the outside, and a seventh  black die in the middle with increments of 10.

The game is to combine the five (you must use all five) multicolored dice, using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, and roots. With the goal value being the sum of the two black dice, the central die being 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and the other die being a standard one. This game can be done solo as a sort of puzzle. Or in a group with individuals attempting to come up with a solution first.

I would like to create a slover that can determine if a certain collection of dice can be combined to acheive the goal value. There are absolutely unsolvable combinations to this device, and it would be very enlightining and helpful to understand if there was a solution when the person playing is unable to find the solution.

Secondly the plastic carrier of my game is cracking in multiple places. I have intentions of repairing or recreating the device, but a software device would also be valued.

I intend to create this program with variable values for die-sides, as well as number of dice. Increasing the number of dice will greatly increase solve time, so I may limit it to a very small number.

It is intended that this project be completed in C++, as that is the program that I am most interested in at the moment. But I could change to Python3, or JavaScript as I have slightly more expeirience with those languages.
